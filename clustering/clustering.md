Ignite nodes can automatically discover each other. This helps to scale the cluster when needed, without having to restart the whole cluster. Developers can also leverage Igniteâ€™s hybrid cloud support that allows establishing connection between private and public clouds such as Amazon Web Services, providing them with the best of both worlds.
