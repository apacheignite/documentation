title: Cluster
excerpt: Ignite has advanced clustering capabilities including logical cluster groups and auto-discovery.
--------------

Ignite nodes can automatically discover each other. This helps to scale the cluster when needed, without having to restart the whole cluster. Developers can also leverage from Igniteâ€™s hybrid cloud support that allows establishing connection between private cloud and public clouds such as Amazon Web Services, providing them with best of both worlds.

Cluster functionality is provided via `IgniteCluster` interface. You can get an instance of `IgniteCluster` from `Ignite` as follows:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "Ignite ignite = Ignition.ignite();\n\nIgniteCluster cluster = ignite.cluster();",
      "language": "java"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Through `IgniteCluster` interface you can:
 * Start and stop remote cluster nodes
 * Get a list of all cluster members
 * Create logical [Cluster Groups](doc:cluster-groups)

}

The `ClusterNode` interface has very concise API and deals only with the node as a logical network endpoint in the topology: its globally unique ID, the node metrics, its static attributes set by the user and a few other parameters.

  "title": "Cluster Node Attributes"
}
[/block]
All cluster nodes on startup automatically register all environment and system properties as node attributes. However, users can choose to assign their own node attributes through configuration:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "<bean class=\"org.apache.ignite.IgniteConfiguration\">\n    ...\n    <property name=\"userAttributes\">\n        <map>\n            <entry key=\"ROLE\" value=\"worker\"/>\n        </map>\n    </property>\n    ...\n</bean>",
      "language": "xml"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Following example shows how to get the nodes where "worker" attribute has been set.
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "ClusterGroup workers = ignite.cluster().forAttribute(\"ROLE\", \"worker\");\n\nCollection<GridNode> nodes = workers.nodes();",
      "language": "java"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "success",
  "body": "All node attributes are available via `ClusterNode.attribute(\"propertyName\")` method."
}
[/block]

[block:api-header]
{
  "type": "basic",
  "title": "Cluster Node Metrics"
}
[/block]
Ignite automatically collects metrics for all cluster nodes. Metrics are collected in the background and are updated with every heartbeat message exchanged between cluster nodes.

Node metrics are available via `ClusterMetrics` interface which contains over 50 various metrics (note that the same metrics are available for [Cluster Groups](doc:cluster-groups)  as well).

Here is an example of getting some metrics, including average CPU load and used heap, for the local node:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "// Local Ignite node.\nClusterNode localNode = cluster.localNode();\n\n// Node metrics.\nClusterMetrics metrics = localNode.metrics();\n\n// Get some metric values.\ndouble cpuLoad = metrics.getCurrentCpuLoad();\nlong usedHeap = metrics.getHeapMemoryUsed();\nint numberOfCores = metrics.getTotalCpus();\nint activeJobs = metrics.getCurrentActiveJobs();",
      "language": "java"
    }
  ]
}

  "title": "Local Cluster Node"
}
[/block]
Local grid node is an instance of the `ClusterNode` representing *this* Ignite node. 

Here is an example of how to get a local node:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "ClusterNode localNode = ignite.cluster().localNode();",
      "language": "java"
    }
  ]
}
