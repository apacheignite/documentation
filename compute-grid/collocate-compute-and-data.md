Collocation of computations with data allow for minimizing data serialization within network and can significantly improve performance and scalability of your application. Whenever possible, you should always make best effort to colocate your computations with the cluster nodes caching the data that needs to be processed.

`affinityCall(...)`  and `affinityRun(...)` methods co-locate jobs with nodes on which data is cached. In other words, given a cache name and affinity key these methods try to locate the node on which the key resides on Ignite the specified Ignite cache, and then execute the job there.
