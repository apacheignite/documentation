The In-Memory SQL Grid allows users to interact with the Ignite platform not only with the usage of natively developed APIs for Java, .NET and C++ but also using standard SQL commands through the Ignite JDBC or ODBC APIs. This provides a true cross-platform connectivity from languages such as PHP, Ruby and more.
