In-Memory SQL Grid adds in-memory distributed database capabilities to Apache Ignite. It is horizontally scalable, fault tolerant and SQL ANSI-99 compliant. 

SQL Grid fully supports all SQL and DML commands including SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, MERGE and DELETE queries. 

To execute the queries, you can leverage all APIs that were specifically created for Java, .NET or C++ programming languages or, alternatively, you can connect to an Ignite cluster using Ignite's JDBC and ODBC driver and execute the queries directly from a favorite programming language or analytical tool.
