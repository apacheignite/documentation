In-Memory SQL Grid is a high-performant and fault-tolerant in-memory distributed database built with a notion of horizontal scalability and conventional SQL support. 

SQL Grid is fully ANSI-99 compliant and allows to execute all the imaginable set of SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, MERGE and DELETE queries in Ignite. 

To execute the queries you can leverage from the APIs that were deliberately created for Java, .NET or C++ programming languages or, alternatively, you can connect to an Ignite cluster using Ignite's JDBC and ODBC driver and execute the queries directly from a favorite programming language or analytical tool.
