Apache Ignite 2.0 incorporates tremendous changes that make it different from previous Apache Ignite 1.x releases. Apache Ignite 2.0 is incompatible with the previous versions and, most likely, application code has to be altered if someone plans to migrate to 2.0.

Refer to the Apache Ignite wiki page to see the main public API changes introduced in version 2.0:
