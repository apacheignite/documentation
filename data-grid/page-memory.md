Page Memory is an abstraction for working with pages in memory. Internally it interacts with a file store which is responsible for allocating page IDs, writing and reading of pages. One should distinguish a concept of a page and a page buffer.

A page is a block of data of a fixed length with a unique identifier called FullPageId.

A page buffer is a region in memory associated with some page.

Page Memory fully handles the process of loading pages to the corresponding page buffers and evicting unused page buffers from memory. At any moment in time page memory may keep any subset of page buffers (fitting to the allocated RAM).

## Primary vs Backup Data

TBD (It's known that a node will first keep primary data in RAM rather than backup data. We need to describe this algorithmâ€‹ here).
