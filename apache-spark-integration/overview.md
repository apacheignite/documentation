Apache Ignite provides an implementation of Spark RDD abstraction which enables easy access to Ignite caches. The main difference between classical Spark RDD and Ignite RDD is that Ignite RDD does not keep it's state in the memory of the Spark application and provides a view of the corresponding Ignite cache instead. Depending on the chosen deployment mode this state may exist only during the lifespan of Spark application (embedded mode) or may exist outside of Spark application (standalone mode), allowing seamless sharing of the state between multiple Spark jobs.
