AWS infrastructure deployment framework simplifies deployment of `Cassandra/Ignite/Tests` clusters in [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/products/?nc2=h_ql_sf_ls) and automates all the routine related to:

1. Creation and bootstrapping of required amount of EC2 instances for `Ignite/Cassandra/Tests` clusters
2. Run load tests and wait for their completion
3. Collect all the load tests statistics from each EC2 instance and produce summary report
4. Provides [Ganglia](http://ganglia.info/) monitoring for your `Ignite/Cassandra/Tests` clusters, thus you can see how your clusters look like under high load  :-)
