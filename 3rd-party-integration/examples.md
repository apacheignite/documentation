As described in [Base concepts](doc:base-concepts) to configure Cassandra as a cache store you need to set **CacheStoreFactory** for your Ignite cache to `org.apache.ignite.cache.store.cassandra.CassandraCacheStoreFactory`.

Below is an example of typical configuration for Ignite cache to use Cassandra as a cache store. The example is taken from the unit tests resource file `test/resources/org/apache/ignite/tests/persistence/blob/ignite-config.xml` of Cassandra module source code.
