Ignite Cassandra module provides a set of load tests which allows you to simulate production load for Ignite and Cassandra with your custom key/value classes and persistence settings. Thus using these load tests you can measure performance characteristics of the system for your specific configuration:
* Set of custom key/value classes
* Set of Ignite nodes
* Set of Cassandra nodes

Such kind of measurements could be useful for better understanding of system scalability and sizing.
